We're going to use them to classify stuff, which is generally called supervised learning. Supervised learning is certainly not the only kind of task you can perform with ANNs, it just forms a good basis for lab project applications like decoding, encoding, and EEG analysis.\n",

    "## Supervised Learning, and other fancy names associated with Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Supervised Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "___Supervised learning___ is the machine learning world's name for almost any kind of *classification task*.  This means that we are trying to get an ANN to distinguish different features or categories present within a dataset, while we already know which labels (also called ground truth) belong to each sample in the set. This is an __iterative process__ in the network guesses the labels for a batch of samples in discrete steps. At every step, guesses are made and scored. The 'supervised' component comes into play because while we train the model (the learning stage), the labels are used as an answer key at each iteration to teach the model how to perform better. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uh.. OK. How do we do this? \n",
    "### Training-Lite\n",
    "The way a model \"learns\" is by passing in a bunch of data points at a time, correcting the model's guess as to what those data points were, and then repeating this process a bunch of times. Before I jumpt into a training script, we need to talk about about how this actually works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Those Fancy Names\n",
    "\n",
    "So remember how our final model layer computes some probability density, and uses that to pick the most likely class for a sample? Well we need to have a way of correcting this process and teaching the model how to do a better job.  That correction takes the form of whats called an ***objective function***, which is used while training the model. Keeping with our high level take, the objective funtion evaluates how well the model is performing by comparing its guesses to the corresponding labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "For most classification tasks,[categorical cross entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy) (also called Softmax or Softmax loss) is used as the ___objective function.___ Basically, it compares the guessed distribution to the label distribution and calculates how much information from the guesses is needed to correctly predict labels, at each step. This comparison returns a ___loss value___ which quantifies the amount of info needed for this comparison (low is good, high is bad). ___Loss___ is the primary metric for model evaluation, and is the metric used by the following concepts to implement network performance ___optimization___.  \n",
    "___*Note___ _the objective function is also called the loss or cost function._  \n",
    "###### We'll be keeping a sky high level for these following concepts as you won't need the nuts and bolts to use the code. However,  I've included links to more thorough explanations that I'd recommend going through  at some point.\n",
    "#### Optimization\n",
    "Loosely, optimization is how a network learns during the training proceedure. It is the process of correcting a network to maximize performance.  It does this by using an ___Optimization Algorithm___ that informs how changes to the weights and biases of model layers should be made, and how those changes affect performance. This is instantiated by some form of ___Stochastic Gradient Descent___ and ___Backpropagation___.  These are pretty thorny concepts, so I'll briefly talk about what is essential and include links to more detailed explanations.  \n",
    "##### Optimization with [Gradient Descent](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [several](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.htmlA) specific algorithms that perform Gradient Descent with their own flavor, but they all esentially do the same thing: find the lowest loss in the objective function.  There are tons of ways to think about this, the most common is to think of the learning process of being a three dimensional gradient like a rough hill. The algorithm is trying to iteratively move in the opposite direction of the hill's highest point (the gradient) to find the lowest point, wherein the hill represents the loss in classification performance ([not my metaphor](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html)).  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### [Backpropagation](https://skymind.ai/wiki/backpropagation) (Backprop for short)\n",
    "\n",
    "___Backpropagation___ is the process of _how_ the information from the gradient descent process affects the network. Because networks are trained iteratively, information from a sample is passed forward to make a guess at each step, but the resulting performance of that guess can be passed backwards as well in the same step. This backwards pass is used to alter the weights and biases of all layers in the network based on a given training step's error or ___loss value___. If the change made at the previous training step increases loss, the __optimization algorithm__ changes direction (literally) with respect to the gradient, and backprops that change through the netowrk.  If the change decreases loss, we keep moving down hill.\n",
